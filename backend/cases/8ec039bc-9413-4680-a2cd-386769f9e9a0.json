  "raw_text": "SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1234 OF 2024 PETITIONER: Ram Kumar RESPONDENT: State of Maharashtra FACTS: The petitioner, Ram Kumar, filed a writ petition challenging the termination of his government employment. He was employed as a clerk in the Maharashtra State Revenue Department for 15 years. On March 15, 2023, he was terminated from service without proper inquiry or show cause notice. The petitioner claims that the termination violated principles of natural justice as he was not given an opportunity to defend himself against the allegations of misconduct. The respondent state claims that the petitioner was involved in accepting bribes from citizens for processing land records. Multiple complaints were received against the petitioner, and surveillance was conducted which allegedly confirmed the allegations. The state argues that immediate termination was necessary to prevent further corruption. ISSUES: 1. Whether the termination of the petitioner without conducting a proper departmental inquiry violated principles of natural justice? 2. Whether the evidence collected through surveillance is admissible and sufficient to justify termination? 3. Whether the petitioner is entitled to reinstatement and back wages? HOLDING: The court observed that the principles of natural justice are fundamental to administrative law and cannot be overlooked. Every employee has the right to be heard before any adverse action is taken against them. The surveillance evidence, while relevant, should have been presented to the petitioner during a proper inquiry. However, the court also noted that the allegations of corruption are serious in nature and cannot be ignored. The state has a duty to maintain integrity in public service. The court held that while the termination procedure was flawed, the petitioner's conduct prima facie suggests misconduct. JUDGMENT: The court set aside the termination order and directed the state to conduct a fresh departmental inquiry within 60 days, following all principles of natural justice. The petitioner shall be deemed to be under suspension during this period. Based on the outcome of the inquiry, appropriate action may be taken. No back wages shall be paid for the suspension period if misconduct is proved.",
